# Maze-Mazter
Repository of the Project "Maze Mazter."

This is just something I work on in my spare time.

I am using Java 15 to code.

This game is planned to be a text based "RPG."

  You are a small child who is perilously thrown into a well where randomness is your friend and foe.
  There are many mechanics that will be very useful to the player. Such as fighting, magic, stealth, and social interactions.

As of right now, I am currently learning how to translate what I created from python, into java.
I will update this more when I finish the technicalities and am able to focus on the creative side.

Of course, I am always open to suggestions.
